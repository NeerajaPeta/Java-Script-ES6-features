# Java-Script-ES6-features
In ES5, we were able to declare variables using var only. But in ES6, we have three ways to declare variables in JavaScript: var, let and const. Here, we will explore the what, why, and how of var, let and const with examples.
var
Scope of var is global or function level. Variable declared within a function has the function level scope otherwise global scope.
Can be re-declared multiple times using var key word and same variable name.
Value of variable declared using var can be updated anywhere within the scope.
