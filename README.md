How to Declare Variables in JavaScript
In JavaScript, we can declare variables in three different ways like this:
// Without keywords. It is essentially the same as var 
// and not allowed in 'strict' mode.
name = 'Jack'; 

// Using var
var price = 100;

// Using let
let isPermanent = false; 

// Using const
const PUBLICATION = 'freeCodeCamp'

Scope
Reassigning a new value
